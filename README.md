ðŸ‘‹ In the dynamic world of the web, I wear multiple hats. From web design to business strategy and hardcore development. I've founded my own agency in my 20s, a move fueled by a passion for making things happen.

ðŸ’¡ If you're looking to turn your project, idea, or business into a reality, count on me to make it happen. I'm here to bring your vision to life. I have a well-rounded skill set that spans across business, web development, social media, software, events, and UI/UX.

ðŸŒ´ On the professional front, I've been a three-time attendee at Web Summit, immersing myself in the latest trends and innovations. Beyond the business hustle, I find joy in capturing moments through photography, exploring new places, and riding waves.

ðŸš€ Eager to transform your concepts into reality and take your projects to the next level? Send me a DM, let's chat!
